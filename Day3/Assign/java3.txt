Q8& 9. How does “strictfp” ensure portability in Java? and At what levels can you apply “strictfp”?
The strictfp keyword must use strict floating-point operations that yield reproducible results. strictfp can be applied at the class, interface or method level.

19. What are the four rules of binary operations?
The four rules of binary operations are -
	If either of the operands is of type double, the other one will be converted to a double. 
	If either of the operands is of type float, the other one will be converted to a float. 
	If either of the operands is of type long, the other one will be converted to a long. 
	Otherwise, both operands will be converted to an int.

20. What is narrow/explicit/down type casting and what is widening/implicit/up type casting?
Widening – Converting a lower data type into a higher one is called widening type casting. It is also known as implicit conversion or casting down. 
Narrowing-  Converting a higher data type into a lower one is called narrowing type casting. It is also known as explicit conversion or casting up.

22. What is harm in doing down casting?
Casting leads to loss in original data.
