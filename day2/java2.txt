ASSIGNMENT-2 (Day-2)
Q1.You are given a task to design a School Management System. Identify all the variable names that according to you would be required for such a system. Also, identify the data types of these variables?
In school management system the variable we require are-
String – for name of students
Integer- for class of students
Integer- for number of students
Float- for marks of students

Q2. Why do languages have data types?
Language have data types to store values of variables . Every language have different data type to store data or values into it. Java have mainly two different category of data types. Primitive and Non- primitive.

Q3.  What are the broad 2 categories of data types in Java?
The two broad category of data type are-
1.Primitive
•	Integer  
•	Floating point
•	Character
•	Boolean
2.Non-primitive
•	String
•	Array
•	Classes 

Q4. What are 4 classification of data types in Java under Primitives?
The four classification of data-type under Primitive are-
•	Integer  
•	Floating point
•	Character
•	Boolean

Q5.Why do we say that Java is a strongly typed language?
Java is a strongly typed language. This means that every variable must have a declared type. And we can not change the type of data type after declaration.

Q7.What sub-categories of Integer data types also mention the size?
The subcategory of Integer data type are-
•	Byte- 1 Byte
•	Short-2 Bytes
•	Int – 4 Bytes
•	Long -8 Bytes

14. Does Java provide Unsigned integers? How do we achieve Unsigned feature in Java?
No, the java does not provide unsigned integer, but to use unsigned integer in java there is  method  Byte.toUnsignedInt(b)  which is used to perform some arithemetic operations.

17. Why are rounding errors caused in Floating arithmetic which makes it unsuitable for financial and mission critical applications.Which class can be used to avoid the errors?
The  roundoff errors are caused by the fact that floating-point numbers are represented in the binary number system which makes it unsuitable for financial application.       BigDecimal class can be used to avoid error.

20. How many characters can Unicode-16 accommodate?
Unicode 16 can accommodate characters of Latin, Greek, Arabic, Tamil, Hebrew, Katakana, Hangul, and many more languages.

21. What two problems Unicode solves?
The two that Unicode solve are-
•	A particular code value corresponds to different letters in the different encoding schemes. 
•	The encodings for languages with large character sets have variable length: Some common characters are encoded as single bytes, others require two or more bytes.

27. Write five valid and five invalid variable names?
Valid variable name are –
•	Int – number
•	String – name
•	Float- average
•	Double- Speed
Invalid variable name are-
•	Float- contact
•	String- class
