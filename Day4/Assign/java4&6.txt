5. What all data types are allowed in the expression of the switch statement?
For versions of Java prior to JDK 7, expression must resolve to type byte, short, int, char, or an enumeration.
Beginning with JDK 7, expression can also be of type String.

6. Why does the switch statement have better performance over the “if” statement?
A switch statement is usually more efficient than a set of nested ifs. When it compiles a switch statement, the Java compiler will inspect each of the case constants and create a “jump table” that it will use for selecting the path of execution depending on the value of the expression.
